# Scriptable Object Mass Adjuster for Unity

A Unity Editor tool that allows for mass editing of Scriptable Objects based on type and a Regex-based search pattern. This tool provides an Editor Window to select a defined scriptable object type, and view the associated layout. Edits can be made on this layout. Based on the regex pattern, all matching files will have the changes applied to it. Untouched fields will be left as is.

## Features

- **Fetch All Scriptable Object Types**: Automatically list all Scriptable Object types available in the Unity project.
- **Search for Scriptable Objects by Name**: Filter through the available Scriptable Object types.
- (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) **Regex-Based File Matching**: Define a regex pattern to search for specific asset files of the selected Scriptable Object type.
- (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) **Mass Edit Scriptable Objects**: Edit properties in an easy-to-use Editor Window and apply changes to all matching files.
